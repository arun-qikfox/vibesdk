# GCP Runtime Notes

## Worker Bundle Artifacts
- `dist/worker-bundle/index.js` – self-hosted worker entrypoint generated by `npm run build:worker`.
- `dist/worker-bundle/index.js.map` – source map saved alongside the bundle.
- `dist/worker-bundle/README.md` – wrangler output metadata describing bindings.

## Runtime Binding Gaps (hand off to Spec 03/04)
- KV, D1, R2, and Durable Object bindings still point to stub modules in `container/workerd/stubs/`.
- GCS, Firestore, and Pub/Sub adapters are in place; remaining Cloudflare-only services will be migrated in `03-data-layer.md` and `04-durable-objects-and-sandbox.md`.

## Data Layer Translation Notes
- Generated PostgreSQL schema lives in `worker/database/schema.gcp.ts`; Cloudflare continues to use `worker/database/schema.ts`.
- Boolean flags now use native `boolean` columns instead of integer toggles.
- Timestamp columns serialize as `timestamptz` to preserve `Date` semantics previously encoded as integer epochs.
- JSON blobs (`preferences`, OAuth scopes, audit deltas, system settings) now store in `jsonb`; default values use Postgres cast literals (e.g., `'{}'::jsonb`).
- `auth_attempts.id` now auto-increments via `serial` to mimic SQLite rowid behavior.
- Cloud Run mounts the Cloud SQL Unix socket at `/cloudsql` and loads `DATABASE_URL` from Secret Manager, generated alongside the database password.
- Firestore collection `FIRESTORE_COLLECTION` (default `vibesdk-kv`) backs the GCP KV adapter; when running outside GCP, set `KV_IN_MEMORY=true` to test the provider locally.
