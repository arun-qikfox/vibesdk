## Error Responses

All disabled features return standardized error responses:

```typescript
// For API endpoints
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ 
    success: false, 
    error: 'Feature temporarily disabled' 
}), { status: 503 });

// For middleware
return null; // or false for boolean returns

// For database operations
return { success: false, error: 'Operation unavailable' };
```

## Re-enablement Plan

2. **Restore Proxy Services**
   - Fix Drizzle ORM issues in `worker/services/aigateway-proxy/controller.ts`
   - Restore `worker/index.ts` functionality

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each service individually as it's re-enabled
- Verify database connections and queries
- Test API endpoint responses

### Integration Testing
- Test authentication flows
- Test app creation and management
- Test sandbox functionality

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Test deployment functionality
- Test custom branding

## Rollback Procedures

If issues arise during re-enablement:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to working state
   git checkout HEAD~1
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Selective Rollback**
   - Comment out problematic services
   - Restore placeholder responses
   - Maintain build stability

3. **Database Rollback**
   - Restore database client configurations
   - Re-enable factory patterns
   - Fix type issues

## Monitoring

### Build Monitoring
- Monitor `npm run build` success
- Track TypeScript compilation errors
- Monitor bundle size changes

### Runtime Monitoring
- Monitor API response times
- Track error rates
- Monitor database connection health

### Feature Monitoring
- Track feature usage after re-enablement
- Monitor performance impact
- Track user experience metrics

## Notes

- **Priority**: Frontend deployment with custom branding takes precedence
- **Stability**: Maintain build success throughout re-enablement process
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test each phase before proceeding
- **Documentation**: Update this document as features are re-enabled
