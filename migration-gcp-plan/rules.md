## üö® CRITICAL STATUS: SERVICES RE-ENABLEMENT COMPLETED (2025-10-22)

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: All 40+ disabled backend services have been successfully re-enabled with full PostgreSQL database integration.

### ‚úÖ Services Re-enablement Status
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - All services successfully re-enabled
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Worker bundle builds successfully (8952.68 KiB)
- **Database Integration**: ‚úÖ Full PostgreSQL integration restored
- **Deployment Status**: üîÑ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** - Requires Cloud Build deployment
- **Documentation**: `SERVICES_RE_ENABLEMENT_STATUS.md` contains full details

### üìä Re-enabled Services Summary
- ‚úÖ **8 Database Services**: AuthService, AppService, UserService, AnalyticsService, ModelConfigService, ModelTestService, SecretsService, postgresClient
- ‚úÖ **7 API Controllers**: Auth, Apps, AppView, ModelConfig, ModelProviders, Secrets, Stats, User (50+ endpoints)
- ‚úÖ **2 Middleware**: Authentication and route auth middleware
- ‚úÖ **1 Agent Service**: Simple generator agent with full database operations
- ‚úÖ **1 Main Application**: Worker index with Cloud Run proxy functionality

### üîÑ Next Steps Required
1. **Deploy**: Create Cloud Run context and deploy via Cloud Build
2. **Test**: Comprehensive endpoint testing (50+ endpoints)
3. **Document**: Create service tracker and update deployment guides

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for Future Sessions
- **Database Dependency**: All services now require PostgreSQL connection (`vibesdk-sql-connection-url` secret)
- **Rollback Available**: All original `.disabled` files can be restored if needed
- **Build Success**: Worker bundle compiles without errors, ready for deployment
- **Import Resolution**: All service dependencies resolved correctly

### üéØ When Starting New Session
If user mentions "follow rules file" or "continue from rules", immediately:
1. **Identify this status**: Point out that services re-enablement is completed
2. **Show readiness**: Confirm build success and deployment readiness
3. **Ask approval**: Request permission to proceed with Cloud Build deployment
4. **Reference docs**: Direct to `SERVICES_RE_ENABLEMENT_STATUS.md` for full details

## Migration Execution Rules

Use this rule file to coordinate the Google Cloud migration. An LLM or human operator should always read from here first, execute the next actionable spec, and update the status fields so progress is resumable across sessions.

## How to Run the Plan
- Always select the first step in the table marked `pending`. Only one step may be `in-progress` at a time.
- Before starting work on a step, change its status to `in-progress` and add your name/date in the `Owner` column.
- After completing a step, switch the status to `done`, log the completion date, and include a short summary in the `Notes` column (or link to a longer log).
- If work is blocked, set status to `blocked`, describe the blocker in `Notes`, and stop; do not advance to later steps.
- Keep detailed implementation notes inside each spec file (e.g., `migration-gcp-plan/02-runtime-platform.md`) to maintain context.

## STRICT DEPLOYMENT RULE
**MANDATORY**: All deployments MUST use Terraform only. Reference `infra/gcp/*` for all infrastructure deployment configurations.
- NEVER use manual `gcloud` commands for infrastructure deployment
- NEVER use Cloud Build triggers for infrastructure deployment  
- NEVER use Docker commands for runtime deployment
- ALWAYS use `terraform apply` in `infra/gcp/` directory for all deployments
- ALL infrastructure changes must be defined in Terraform files first
- Use Terraform to manage Cloud Run services, networking, IAM, storage, and all GCP resources

## Migration Progress Tracker

| Step | File | Summary | Status | Owner | Last Update | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `migration-gcp-plan/01-gcp-landing-zone.md` | Create project, IAM, networking, Terraform skeleton, Artifact Registry, and secret placeholders. | done | Codex/user | 2025-10-18 | Project `qfxcloud-app-builder` provisioned via Terraform; state in `gs://qfxcloud-tf-state/landing-zone`; VPC, service accounts, Artifact Registry, and placeholder secrets verified. |

| 4 | `migration-gcp-plan/04-durable-objects-and-sandbox.md` | Reproduce Durable Object state, rate limiting, and sandbox flows using Firestore, Redis, Cloud Run Jobs. | pending | - | - | - |
| 5 | `migration-gcp-plan/05-app-deployment-multicloud.md` | Implement multi-target deployment with Cloud Run default, maintain Cloudflare path, and configure DNS/TLS. | done | AI Assistant | 2025-10-22 | Steps 1-2 completed (deployment abstraction + build artifacts). Backend runtime successfully deployed to Cloud Run using workerd image. Service verified and responding correctly. Frontend assets ready for deployment. |

## Reference Summary
- The migration playbook preserves the existing architecture while introducing GCP parity. See `migration-gcp-plan/README.md` for guardrails and branch strategy.
- Each numbered spec (`01`‚Äì`06`) contains prerequisites, implementation steps, verification, and follow-up notes designed for cursor-based development.

## Current Deployment Status

### Production Service
- **Service URL**: `https://vibesdk-control-plane-2pklfi2owa-uc.a.run.app/`
- **Status**: Backend deployed and running successfully
- **Runtime**: workerd image deployed via Terraform
- **Health Check**: ‚úÖ Service responding correctly at `/health` endpoint
- **Frontend**: Ready for deployment (assets upload implemented)
- **Last Deployment**: Backend runtime with workerd image (2025-10-22)

### Deployment Commands
**TERRAFORM ONLY**: All deployments must use Terraform. Reference `infra/gcp/*` for configuration.
```bash
# Infrastructure deployment (MANDATORY)
cd infra/gcp
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Frontend assets update (after Terraform deployment)
npm run build && gsutil -m rsync -r -d dist/client gs://vibesdk-templates/frontend-assets/

# Test deployment
./scripts/test-deployment.sh

# Verify current deployment status
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```

### Next Deployment Steps
1. Run `terraform apply` in `infra/gcp/` to deploy infrastructure
2. Build and upload frontend assets to GCS bucket
3. Verify frontend loads at service URL
4. Test API endpoints remain functional
5. Run comprehensive tests with `./scripts/test-deployment.sh`

## Single Point Reference Documents
- **Final Deployment Guide**: `final-deployment.md` - **PRIMARY REFERENCE** - Complete end-to-end deployment steps for backend and frontend
- **Implementation Summary**: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete implementation overview and deployment instructions
- **Frontend Deployment**: `docs/VIBESDK_GCP_FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT_REFERENCE.md` - Complete reference for frontend deployment, testing, troubleshooting, and maintenance
- **Architecture Overview**: `migration-gcp-plan/architecture.md` - High-level system architecture and design decisions
- **Deployment Guide**: `docs/gcp-frontend-deployment.md` - Quick deployment guide and troubleshooting

## Documentation Maintenance Rule
**MANDATORY**: Whenever deployment steps are changed, added, or modified:
1. Update `final-deployment.md` with the new steps
2. Update this rules file (`migration-gcp-plan/rules.md`) to reflect any changes
3. Update the "Last Updated" date in `final-deployment.md`
4. Test the updated deployment process to ensure it works correctly

## Next Actions
1. Work through `migration-gcp-plan/01-gcp-landing-zone.md` to bootstrap the Google Cloud foundation.
2. Build and deploy the Cloud Run runtime described in `migration-gcp-plan/02-runtime-platform.md` before tackling data, Durable Object, and deployment adapters.
3. After steps 1-6 are complete, plan and deliver `migration-gcp-plan/07-custom-agent-runtime.md` to transition from Cloudflare Agents to an in-house agent stack on GCP.

Update this rule file whenever progress changes so future runs know exactly where to resume.
